# Data repo's

- Contains implementations of repo's.
- Returns NumberTriviva and Failure objects. To be specific we're returning an Either object which is a functional programming concept.
- Catch exceptions early here and then return failure objects from here. This prevents try/catching exceptions all over the place.
